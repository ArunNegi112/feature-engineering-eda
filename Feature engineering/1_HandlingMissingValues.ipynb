    "In MCAR dataset, data points are missing randomly with no pattern or any particular reason,  \n",
    "- No systematic pattern in the missingness.  \n",
    "- The probability of missing data is the same for all observations. And is unrelated to any variable in dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "ex : During data entry, some values are accidentally left blank or lost due to technical glitch. \n",
    "\n",
    "### _2. MAR (Missing At Random)_\n",
    "In MAR dataset, missing data points do not depend on missing data, rather they depend on observed data.\n",
    "- Missingness depends on other variables (variable that contain observed data) in the dataset.\n",
    "- The missing data can be predicted using observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex : In an internet survey, respondents from rural areas (observed variable) are more likely to skip questions about internet usage (missing variable). The missingness is related to location, not to internet usage itself.\n",

    "### _3. MNAR (Missing Not At Random)_\n",
    "In MNAR dataset, the missing data points depends on missing data itself or some other unobserved factor\n",
    "- The reason for missing data is linked to the value itself.\n",
    "- Ignoring it can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex : In an income survey, people with very high salaries might skip answering income-related questions because they feel uncomfortable revealing their earnings. The missingness depends on income itself (the unobserved or missing variable).\n",
